# Introduction to AI Assisted Content Creation with .NET - TDNUG 1/18/2023

## What is AI assisted Content Creation?

AI assisted content creation is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to help create content. 

AI assistance can be used to produce a wide range of content, including text, images, videos, audio, and interactive experiences. 

Text-based content can include articles, blog posts, social media posts, and product descriptions. AI-generated images can be used for graphics and illustrations. AI-generated videos can be used for educational tutorials or promotional videos. 

AI-generated audio can be used for podcasts or music production. Finally, AI-assisted interactive experiences can include virtual reality simulations or chatbot conversations.

AI-assisted content generation can help software developers save time and resources by automating the process of creating code, documentation, and other technical content. 

AI-assisted content generation can also help software developers improve the quality of their work by providing accurate and up-to-date information on coding techniques and best practices. 

Additionally, AI-assisted content generation can help to reduce the time it takes to debug code by providing quick feedback on potential errors before they are implemented.

## My Take

I believe that AI assisted content creation will play a predominant role in the future of software development. Software developers will be able to use AI to create code, documentation, and other technical content. In addition, AI will be able to help software developers improve the quality of their work by providing accurate and up-to-date information on coding techniques and best practices.

It's much better to be prepared how to use AI assisted content creation than to be left behind or to worry about AI completely taking over your job.
